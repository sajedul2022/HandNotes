1) Element namespaces are denoted by the 'namespace' attribute          
2) converting an element to a string denotes text data                  OK
3) Non-numeric indexes are element attributes                           OK
4) Numeric indexes are elements                                         OK
5) Properties denote element iterators                                  OK
