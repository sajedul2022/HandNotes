// When working with a database, which of the following can be used to mitigate the possibility of exposing your database credientials to a malicious user?

1) Moving all database credentials into a single file
2) Moving all database credentials outside of the document root						*
3) Restricting access to files not designed to be executed independently			*
4) Setting creditial information as system environment variables					*
5) Using PHP constants instead of variables to store credentials
