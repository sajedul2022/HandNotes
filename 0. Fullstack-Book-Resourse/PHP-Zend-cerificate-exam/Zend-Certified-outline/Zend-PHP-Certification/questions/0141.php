// When writing portable database code using PDO, what is the PDO::ATTR_CASE attribute useful for?

1) None of the above
2) Ensuring that all columns are of a particular case when fetched							http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.setattribute.php
3) Adjusting the case of a query before it is processed for compatibility reasons
4) Controls the switch logic of how queries are processed
5) Allows you to adjust the memory cache (or "case") for increased performance
