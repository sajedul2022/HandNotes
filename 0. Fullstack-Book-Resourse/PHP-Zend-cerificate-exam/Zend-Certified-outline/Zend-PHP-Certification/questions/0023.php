// What is the primary difference between a method declared as static and a normal method?

/*

1) Static methods can only be called using the :: syntax and never from an instance
2) Static methods do not provide a reference to $this										OK PHP 5.3
3) Static methods cannot be called from within class instances
4) Static methods don't have access to the self keyword
5) There is no functional difference between a static and non-static method
