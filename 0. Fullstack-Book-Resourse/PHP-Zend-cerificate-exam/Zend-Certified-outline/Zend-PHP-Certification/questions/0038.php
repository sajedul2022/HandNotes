// What is the best way to ensure the distinction between filtered / trusted and unfiltered / untrusted data?

/*

1) None of the above
2) Never trust any data from the user
3) Enable built-in security features such as magic_quotes_gpc and safe_mode
4) Always filter all incoming data
5) Use PHP 5's tainted mode
