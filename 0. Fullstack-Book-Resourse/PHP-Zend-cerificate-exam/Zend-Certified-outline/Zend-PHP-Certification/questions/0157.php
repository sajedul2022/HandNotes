// What is the difference between the include and require language constructs?

1) Require constructs can't be used with URL filenames
2) Include constructs cause a fatal error if the file doesn't exist
3) There is no difference other than the name
4) Include constructs are processed at run time; require constructs are processed at compile time
5) Require constructs cause a fatal error if the file can't be read									// http://php.net/manual/en/function.require.php
